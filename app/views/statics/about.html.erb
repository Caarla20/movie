				<h4><b>WHAT IS THE TOMATOMETER®?</b></h4>
				<p>The Tomatometer rating - based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and television critics - is a trusted measurement of movie and TV programming quality for millions of moviegoers.

				The Tomatometer rating represents the percentage of professional critic reviews that are positive for a given film or television show.

				Back in the days of the open theaters, when a play was particularly atrocious, the audience expressed their dissatisfaction by not only booing and hissing at the stage, but throwing whatever was at hand -- vegetables and fruits included.</p>
